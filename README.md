This repository contains the work for an Agile‑driven software development project using Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) practices. The goal is to design and implement a modular order‑processing system that supports:

Order placement

Confirmation emails

Newsletter signup

Phone‑based account verification

Secure payment handling

Customer account management

Inventory management

The project emphasizes iterative delivery, continuous testing, and customer‑focused development.

Methodology
Scrum Practices
Sprint planning

Daily stand‑ups

Sprint reviews

Retrospectives

Velocity tracking

Scrum Progress Reports

Extreme Programming (XP) Practices
User stories written from the customer’s perspective

Ideal week estimation

Release planning using velocity

Iteration planning using ideal programming days

Test‑driven development (TDD)

Continuous integration

Refactoring for maintainability

Honest, unmodified estimates

User Stories
The project includes 10 user stories, each with:

A clear user goal

Functional requirements

Ideal week estimates

Acceptance criteria

These stories form the basis of the release plan and iteration breakdown.

Release Plan
A project velocity of 9 ideal weeks was used to group user stories into iterations.
The release plan ensures:

Highest‑value stories are completed first

Workload per iteration aligns with velocity

Snow‑plowing is used when necessary

Estimates remain unchanged for accuracy

Iteration Planning
Each iteration includes:

Selected user stories

Breakdown into programming tasks

Task estimates in ideal programming days

Developer sign‑ups

Verification that total task effort does not exceed velocity

Tasks are written in developer language, while stories remain in customer language.

Tools & Technologies
Jira – story tracking and progress reporting

GitHub – version control and collaboration

VS Code or equivalent IDE

Unit testing framework (based on language used)

Agile estimation tools (ideal weeks, ideal days, velocity tracking)

Progress Reporting
Scrum Progress Reports include:

Completed work

Obstacles and mitigation plans

Next steps

Confirmation of completed user story modules

Reports are also communicated to the instructor through Jira comments and @mentions.

Java Web Framework CLI Demo
This section demonstrates a command-line interface for selecting Java web frameworks. The menu allows users to choose from several popular frameworks and displays a brief description based on the selection.
